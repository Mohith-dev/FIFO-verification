always @(posedge clk)
  a <= b;

always @(a)
  c <= a;


At the same posedge clk:
a <= b schedules an NBA update
a changes → triggers the second always block
That second block schedules another NBA update
This cannot happen in one delta.
So the simulator must:
finish one delta
see new events
start another delta
repeat until stable
Only then can time move forward

SO WE HAVE MULTIPLE DELTA CYCLES IN A SINGLE SIMULATION TIME 

Time advances only when there are no more runnable events at the current time.
